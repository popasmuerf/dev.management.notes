FP counting process involves the following steps
====================================================
	1.	Determine the type of count
	2.	Determine the boundary of the count
	3.	Indentify each Elementary Process(EP) required
		the user.
	4.	Determine the unique EPs
	5.	Measure data functions
	6.	Measure transactional functions
	7.	Calculate functional size(unadjusted function point
		count)
	8.	Determine Value Adjustment Factor(VAF)
	9.	Calculate adjusted function point count


Note: General System Characteristics (GCSs)
are made optional CPM 4.3.2 and 
moved to Appendix.  Hence, Step 8 and Step 9
can be skipped
==========================================


Development Function Point Count
==========================================
Functions can be counted at all phases
of a development project from
requirement to implemetation stage.
This type of count is associated with new
development work and may include prototypes,
which, which may have been required as
temporary solution, which
supports the conversion effort.  This type
of count is called a basline function point 
count.
