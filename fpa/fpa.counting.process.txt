FP counting process involves the following steps
====================================================
	1.	Determine the type of count
	2.	Determine the boundary of the count
	3.	Indentify each Elementary Process(EP) required
		the user.
	4.	Determine the unique EPs
	5.	Measure data functions
	6.	Measure transactional functions
	7.	Calculate functional size(unadjusted function point
		count)
	8.	Determine Value Adjustment Factor(VAF)
	9.	Calculate adjusted function point count


Note: General System Characteristics (GCSs)
are made optional CPM 4.3.2 and 
moved to Appendix.  Hence, Step 8 and Step 9
can be skipped
==========================================


Development Function Point Count
==========================================
Functions can be counted at all phases
of a development project from
requirement to implemetation stage.
This type of count is associated with new
development work and may include prototypes,
which, which may have been required as
temporary solution, which
supports the conversion effort.  This type
of count is called a basline function point 
count.


Application Function Point Count
==========================================
Appliation counts are calculated as the function points
delivered, and excluded any conversion
effort(prototypes or temporary solutions)


Enhancement Function Point Count
===========================================
When changes are made to software after production,
they are considered as enhancements. To size such 
enhancement projects, theFunction Point Count gets
added, changed, or deleted in the application.

Determine the Boundary of the Count
============================================
The boundary indicates the border between
the application being measured and teh 
external applicatons or the user domain


How do we determine the boundary ?
--------------------------------------------
	1.	The purpose of the function
		point count
	2.	Scope of the application being
		measured
	3.	How and which applications 
		maintain what data
	4.	The business areas that
		support the applications


Identify each elementary process required b the user
===================================================
Compose and/or decompose the functional user requirements into the
smallest unit  of the activity, which satisfies all 
of the following criteria.

	*	Is meaningful to the user
	*	Constitutes a complete transaction
	*	Is self-contained
	*	leaves the business of the application
		being counted in a consistent state

Determine the Unique Elementary Process
====================================================
Comparing two EPs already identified, count them as one EP(same EP)
if they
