The benefits of Function Point Analysis
==========================================

1. The ability to accurately estimate:
    1.  Project cost
    2.  Project duration
    3.  Project staffing size
    
2.  An understanding of other important metrics, such as:
    1.  Project defect rate
    2.  Cost per FP
    3.  FP's per hour (What I refere to as "velocity")
    4.  The productivity benefits of using new or different tools
    
 
As an example of what FPs can do fo you, my company can now tacke projects
on a fixe-priced basis.  This gives you a significant advantage against
your competition, because most people think it is impossible to build software
on a fixed-priced basis.
