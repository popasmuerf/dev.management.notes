A Function  Point(FP)  is a unit of measurement to express the
amount of business functionality, an information system (as a product)
provides to a user.  FPs measures software size roughly.  Thy are
widely accepted as an industry standard for functional sizing.



For sizing software based on FP, several recogonized standards and/or
public specifications have come into existence.  As of 2013:


ISO standards
===========================================
	

COSMIC − ISO/IEC 19761:2011 Software engineering. A functional size measurement method.

FiSMA − ISO/IEC 29881:2008 Information technology - Software and systems engineering - FiSMA 1.1 functional size measurement method.

IFPUG − ISO/IEC 20926:2009 Software and systems engineering - Software measurement - IFPUG functional size measurement method.

Mark-II − ISO/IEC 20968:2002 Software engineering - Ml II Function Point Analysis - Counting Practices Manual.

NESMA − ISO/IEC 24570:2005 Software engineering - NESMA function size measurement method version 2.1 - Definitions and counting guidelines for the application of Function Point Analysis.



Elementary Process(EP)
============================================
Elementary Process is the smallest unit of functiional user
requirement that :

	*	Is meaningful to the user
	*	Constitutes a complete transaction
	*	Is self-contained and leaves the business of 
		the appliction being counted in a consistent
		state.

Functions
============================================
	*	Data functions
		-	Internal Logical Files
		-	External Interface Files



External Interface Files(EIF)
============================================
EIF is a user identifiable group of logically
related data or control information that is used
by the application for reference 
purposes only.  the data resides entirely outside
the appliction boundary and is maintained in an ILF
by another application.  An EIF has the inherent meaning that is
externally maintained, an inteface has to be developed to
get the data from the file.


Transactions Functions
=============================================
There are three types of transaction functions

	*	External Inputs
	*	External Outputs
	*	External Inquiries



External Inputs:
===================================
EIs is a transacton function in which 
Data goes "into" te application from
outside the boundary to inside.  This data is 
coming external to the application.


Definition of RETs, DETs, FTRs
===================================
*RET = Record Element Type
	-	A record element type (RET) is the largest user
		identifiable subgroup of elements within an
		ILF or an EIF.  It is best to look at logical
		groupings of data to help identify them.

*FTR = File Type Referenced
	-	File Type Referenced(FTR) is the largest user 			identifiable subgroup within the EI, EO, or
		EQ that is reference


*DET = Data Element Type 
	-	Data Element Type(DET) is the data subgroup with a FTR
		They are unique and user identifiable withn the 
		EI, EO, or EQ that is referenced to 






	*	Data may come from a dtat input screen 
		or another application
	*	An EI is how an application gets information
	*	Data can be either control information or business
		information
	*	Data may be used to maintain one or more internal
		Logical Files
	*	If the data is control information, it does not have to
		update an ILF

External Outputs:
=====================================
Exteranl Output(EO) is a transaction function in which data
comes "out" of the system.
Additionally, an EO may update an ILF.  The data creates reports
or output files sent to other applications.

External Inquiries
=====================================
External Inquiry(EQ) is a transaction function with both
input and outpu components that result
in data retrieval.
